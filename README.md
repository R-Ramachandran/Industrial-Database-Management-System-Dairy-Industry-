# Industrial Database Management System (Dairy Industry)
<ul>
  <li>
    The Dairy Management System is a database management system which can be used to maintain the records of seller, sales, staff, etc..
  </li>
  <li>
    Even though technologies are evolving day to day, still rural people are not benefitted with most of the technologies. Due to this fact, rural people face difficulties in doing jobs related to record maintenance, calculation of profit or loss, etc..
  </li>
  <li>
    Therefore, I have developed a Graphical User Interface(GUI) application which can help to have efficient communication between rural people and Dairy industry.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>NOTE</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    This application is not in executable format(.exe). So, you can't execute directly.
  </li>
  <li>
    You should have PyQT5 python module, python and MySQL module installed, for executing.
